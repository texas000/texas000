# Algorithm Study

I've started solving algorithm problems at [leetcode](https://leetcode.com)

Try with the Two Sum, which is the easiest problem in the website.

Let me know if you want some assistance ;)

## Definition

    In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or to perform a computation. Algorithms are always unambiguous and are used as specifications for performing calculations, data processing, automated reasoning, and other tasks.

## How to study

Studying algorithm is nightmare.
Personally, I picked my comfortable language which is javacsript.
Luckily, I found the algorithm textbook called "JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms - An Introduction to Understanding and Implementing Core Data Structure and Algorithm Fundamentals by Sammie Bae".

**Good Luck y'all**
